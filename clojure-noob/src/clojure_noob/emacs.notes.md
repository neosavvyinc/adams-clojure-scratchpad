### EMACS Notes

Open a buffer: C-x b RET
Save buffer as file: C-x C-s

C-x o	Switch cursor to another window. Try this now to switch between your Clojure file and the REPL.
C-x 1	Delete all other windows, leaving only the current window in the frame. This doesn’t close your buffers, and it won’t cause you to lose any work.
C-x 2	Split frame above and below.
C-x 3	Split frame side by side.
C-x 0	Delete current window.


Change Mode: M-x clojure-mode RET 
Set Namespace for Cider: C-c M-n
Compile Active Clojure: C-c C-k
